scope

variable or function defined inside a function isn't available outside of the function (local scope)
global scope = function defined outside of a function on top level. 

to use global var:

global_var = 0
def function():
    global global_var
    global_var += 1

this doesn't give a good overview, better use return

global_var = 0
def function():
    return global_var + 1
    
global_var = function()

naming convention:
global constant (not changing variable)
define name in captitals
