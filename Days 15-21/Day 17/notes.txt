class
Class needs first letter of every word capitalized (PascalCase)

camelcase = first word lower and others high like camelCase

snake_case = all words lowercase but with underscore

add pass to empty function or class to avoid errors

constructor is what happens when a class is called build using __init__(self, variables)

class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id, username):     #this is called the constructor
        self.id = user_id
        self.username = usernameuser_id


defaults can be used as well
