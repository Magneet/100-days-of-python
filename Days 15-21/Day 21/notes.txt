opening files using with will make it close automatically so you don't need to close it
dir = "d:\\GIT\\100-days-of-python\\Day 24\\"   #don't forget the extra \ to scape the \

with open(f"{dir}text.txt", mode="a") as file:   # mode default is read only w is for write (overwrite a for append)
    file.write("\nfdfddffsdfdsfsdfsd\n")

with open(f"{dir}text.txt") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)

if a file doesn't exists it will be craeted
